# cab-drives

A taxi company wants to assign drivers to its different units. The company has a list of drivers whose important fields are: name, surname, identity card, telephone. In the same way, there is a list of vehicles that includes: make, model, year. The functionality is to develop a table where the assigned drivers and vehicles are displayed, as well as a window, section or modal where a form can be added to assign a driver to a unit.
